# The Loop

A python script to take a group of users most listened to songs (short-term) on spotify, and create a playlist with those songs. In progess.

## Initial goals

We need to:

1. initialize as user with permissions to create a playlist
2. get their most-played song in the shortest term possible (daily?)
3. create a playlist with this song
4. Support multiple users, and multiple songs (write w this in mind)
